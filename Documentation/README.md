# iOS Development Standards and Best Practices

# Purpose

Provide guidance on the best practices we use within the Deloitte Studios Apple practice for technical design and application architecture.

# Deloitte iOS Development Standards

TBD - This section should point to a tree of Deloitte Studios iOS standards and practices.

for example, coding standards, architecture review board, development processes (PRs, CI/CD, etc)

# Deloitte iOS Development Best Practices

Best Practices are defined here as a set of patterns and tools that we, as Deloitte Studios iOS engineers, agree to use because we judge them to promote high quality in the software we build. They are developed collaboratively across our US and USI studios. 

Documenting them serves three main purposes:

1. To promote consistency of technical architecture and design across the iOS practice
2. To accelerate the onboarding of new developers into the practice
3. To focus sharing of technical expertise and facilitate ongoing discussions among developers

It's important to ensure that our best practices evolve as the underlying technology evolves and also as we advance our own thinking through collaborative, constructive discussion.

The practices are grouped into the following topic areas: 

[Project Configuration](ProjectConfiguration/build-configurations.md)
