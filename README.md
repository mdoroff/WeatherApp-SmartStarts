# Introduction

This is your starting point for all things related to Deloitte Studios SmartStarts for iOS Mobile Development

# Background: 

SmartStarts is an initiative to accelerate development processes by providing project templates that include a baseline architecture and feature set that follows best practices. 

The template projects can be used for either client or internal projects where there is not an existing code base. For client projects where there is an established code base, the SmartStarts project architecture discussions and examples can still be helpful for guiding technical assessments and refactoring.

# Structure of the iOS SmartStart Repository

The iOS SmartStart repository is located here (see section at the bottom of this document for how to get access):

<https://github.com/Deloitte/dd-smartstart-apple>

The iOS SmartStarts consist of two parts:

1. A set of **template** and example projects that can be used as the foundation when starting a new project. Currently there is one [_‘default’_ template](template-projects/default/README.md), but we plan to add a small number of others that are tailored for specific kinds of projects. Typically, the example code is added as part of the template. Each template will have a README markdown file that describes the setup and use of the template and any examples contained in it. There may optionally be additional documentation for the template under the 'doc' subfolder.
2. **Documentation** for more general Deloitte _development standards and practices_. It mirrors the documentation in this [Outline site](https://deloitte1.getoutline.com/doc/apple-nBgw2jOPTw) and sits in the Documentation directory under the root [dd-smartstart-apple](https://github.com/Deloitte/dd-smartstart-apple) directory. See the [README](Documentation/README.md) file in the Documentation folder for details.

If you are planning to contribute to the iOS SmartStart code or documentation you should **clone** this repository, but if you are planning to use it as a SmartStart for a new project it is better to download a zipped copy of it to avoid copying down the .git information.
